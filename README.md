This is my first attempt of doing anything in Phoenix framework. Definitely it is an interesting framework with some novel designs. You should consider to try Phoenix and Elixir language at least for fun as well. Application itself is as basic as it can be, simple CRUD allowing you to create, view, edit and remove posts by any user as there is no user authentication implemented.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
